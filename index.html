	<p>paragraph about a paragrah about a paragrah. I really think that sasha owuld beenfit if she could type faster even if she made tyoos she whould be abble to impress poeple with the speed at which she can write. 
	how else is she going to compete in a writing contest if she can't type fast. See. I could write like 10 short stories and she wouldnt even write like 10 sentences. casue I am a supertyper. Pracice is important!!!!! Especially if you code!!!! </p>
