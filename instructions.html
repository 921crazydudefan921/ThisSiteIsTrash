	So now we are going to try doing html with style.

	What are some things we can do?


	We can 
		1. Change text color ie - 
			color: red;
		2. Change text size
			font-size: 14px;
		3. Change background color
			background-color: blue;
		4. Change the width
			width: 10px
		5. Change the height
			height: 100px
		6. Change padding
			padding: 10px

	What is this PX stuff?
		px = pixels

	You can also reference sizes using 
		em
		rem
		vh
		vw 
	examples
		height: 10em
		width: 10vw

	What do each of them mean?



	How does style know what to change?

	tagType {
			property: value;
	}

	.className {
			property: value;

	}

	#tagId {
		property: value;
	}

	What is a classname?

	You can make custom tags by doing 

	<p className="className"> This is a colorful tag </p>
