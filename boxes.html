        <div class="column">Back in 2001 someone in the DreamWorks animation studio decided that shreck would be a punish for the animaters that had problems on the project Prince of Egypt. As a punishment they had to work on shrek, whitch in a ironic twist was actually the thrid most watched film this year on netflix from march 7th all the way to march 13th. Fun fact, Shreck 2 alone made twice as much money as the film they were getting "punished" for.

        <div class="column">Funfact that is actually pretty well known is that Nic Cage turned down the now very famous role because of the way kids would look at him after. Another thing was that Cameron diaz not the orginal voice of Princess Fiona. Oringianlly the role was going Janeane Garofalo to voice princess Fiona but was fired without being explained why. Another thing was voice actor John Lithgow going against his own personal standards to voice lord farquaad. He always said he would never voice anyone who is short until this role was offord to him and he accepted because it was something new for him.
